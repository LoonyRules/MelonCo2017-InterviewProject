# MelonCo2017-InterviewProject
This was the project I did for MelonCo's recruitment process in May 2017.

Requirements:
* Spigot 1.8.8 jar
* Java 8

Basic IntelliJ Setup Guide:
* Clone this repository
* Create an empty project
* File > New > Module from Existing Sources...
* Select the pom.xml file for this repository.
* Click next unless you need to edit settings to your liking.
* Make sure you have your Maven window open (View > Tool Windows > Maven Projects)
* Click the "Crates" project and build.
* Copy/Move the "Crates.jar" found in the "targets" into your "/plugins" folder.

In-game Guide:
* Find or place down an EnderChest
* Right-Click the EnderChest with an Iron Hoe in your hand
* Wait until the Pointer stops to see what you would've won.

What I need to improve on (feedback):
* Quality of the code is "very good", however, the project itself doesn't show my creativity skills as it's just a basic chest spinner.
